An Bertrandt Coding Challange Projekt

Work in Progress, basic functionality already implemented

Fastest Way : Erde -> 810 -> 595 -> 132 -> 519 -> 71 -> 432 -> b3-r7-r4nd7
Length: 2.995688 Units

[find fastest way from "Erde" to "b3-r7-r4nd7"] :0.001sec

THE FASTEST WAY IS: 
(Erde) -> (node_810) -> (node_595) -> (node_132) -> (node_519) -> (node_71) -> (node_432) -> (b3-r7-r4nd7)
And 2.995688 Units long
